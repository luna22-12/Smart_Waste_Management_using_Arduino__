# Smart_Waste_Management_using_Arduino__
## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview This project is a Smart Waste Management System developed using Arduino Nano.   It uses an Ultrasonic Sensor to measure the garbage level inside a dustbin.   When the bin is full, a White LED lights up and a buzzer sounds an alert.   This system helps in monitoring waste bins automatically without manual checking.
